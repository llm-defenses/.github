## LLM Defenses 👋

The military rule-of-thumb is that defense is easier than offense. Is this so? How would this apply in the case of
attacking and defending LLMs? This GitHub organization is meant to serve as a community repository of approaches
to defending LLMs from adversarial attacks.

Adversarial attacks on LLMs is being actively worked on by major AI companies. A very good example of this work
is the recent paper by researchers at CMU and [Google Deep Mind](https://deepmind.google/)
["Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043).
Their work can be found under the GitHub organization "llm-attacks" [here](https://github.com/llm-attacks].
